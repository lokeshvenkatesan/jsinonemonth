1. index.html 
JavaScript in the browser uses an event-driven programming model. An event is a signal that something has happened. Examples of events are the page completing loading, a user clicking on a button, hovering on an element, typing into an input box, submitting a form, etc. JavaScript enables you to respond to events using Event Handlers. You can attach an event handler to the HTML element for which you want to respond to when a specific event occurs.

Events - any action that causes something else to happen. ie: When you refresh the page, a pop-up pops up. Or when you click a button, a form submits.

2. Comments.html
In computer programming, comments are annotations in the source code of a computer program that are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. You should add useful comments to your code to explain what the code does to make it easier for another programmer (or your future self) to go through the code and understand what it's doing and how it works.

Comments - Code that exists to make things clearer, either for your future self or other developers. Comments will not run anything and can be used to shut off parts of your scripts, which is especially useful for debugging.

3.print.html
At some point, you are going to have to write code that displays some output to the user. In JavaScript, you can write to the DOM (Document Object Modelâ€”we'll cover the DOM later, but basically, what's written to the DOM determines what's shown in the browser) using the document.write() function.

Print - Allows you to put things on the screen.

4. variables.html
In programming, a variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. You can think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory, which can then be used throughout your program.

Variables - a value that can change, depending on conditions or information passed to the program. There are many reasons variables are useful, but in this lesson you can see how they make it really easy to change one thing that will show up changed everywhere it's referenced, saving you tons of time and headache.
